WRONG: because this can only select customers in at least a month of June or July, it can't select customers in both June and July

method 1
SELECT customer_id, name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
  SELECT customer_id

  GROUP BY customer_id

)
 and customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id

  WHERE (month(order_date), year(order_date))= (7,2020)
  GROUP BY customer_id

  method 2
  SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name
