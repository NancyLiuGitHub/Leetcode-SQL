OTHER'S SOLUTION

select '[0-5>' as bin, count(session_id) as total
from Sessions
where duration < 300

union

select '[5-10>' as bin, count(session_id) as total
from Sessions
where duration >= 300 and duration < 600

union

select '[10-15>' as bin, count(session_id) as total
from Sessions
where duration < 900 and duration >= 600

union

select '15 or more' as bin, count(session_id) as total
from Sessions
