SELECT contest_id, round(100*count(user_id)/(select count(user_id) from users),2) as percentage
FROM register
GROUP BY contest_id
ORDER BY percentage desc, contest_id
##wrong

select contest_id, round(100*count(distinct r.user_id)/count(distinct u.user_id),2) as percentage
FROM users u, register r
GROUP BY contest_id
