SELECT distinct sub_id, ifnull(num,0) as number_of_comments
FROM submission s left join (
  SELECT parent_id, count(distinct sub_id) as num

or

SELECT s1.sub_id, count(distinct s2.sub_id) as number_of_comments
FROM submission s1 left join submission s2 on s1.sub_id = s2.parent_id
WHERE s1.parent_id IS NULL
GROUP BY s1.sub_id
