employee: Id, Company, Salary
goal: median salary of each company
5 employees ->3
6 employees ->3,4

1)rank for each company
2)if mod(count(id)/2) = 1, select id where r = round(count(id)/2), otherwise select id where r in count(id)/2 and count(id)/2+1

select id, company_id, salary
from (
  select *, 
  count(id) over (partition by company_id) as c,
  row_number() over (partition by company_id order by salary) as r
  from employee
  )
where 
case when mod(c/2) = 1 then r = round(c/2)
  else r in (c/2, (c/2)+1)
  end
