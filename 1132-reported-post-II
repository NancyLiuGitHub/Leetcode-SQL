My SOLUTION

with t1 as(
SELECT action_date, count(distinct post_id) as spam FROM actions 
WHERE extra = 'spam'
GROUP BY action_date )

with t2 as (
SELECT action_date, count(disctinct post_id) as remove FROM actions
WHERE post_id IN (Select post_id from removals) and extra = 'spam')

select avg(round((spam-ifnull(remove,0))/spam,2))
from t1 left join t2 on t1.action_date = t2.action_date


OTHER SOLUTION
select round(avg(daily_count), 2) as average_daily_percent
from (select count(distinct r.post_id)/count(distinct a.post_id)*100 as daily_count
    from actions a
    left join removals r
    on a.post_id = r.post_id
    where extra = 'spam'
    group by action_date
    ) tmp
