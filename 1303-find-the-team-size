SELECT e.employee_id, t.team_size
FROM employee e
left join (
SELECT team_id, count(employee_id) as team_size
FROM employee
GROUP BY team_id) t
on e.team_id = t.team_id


OTHER SOLUTION (simplier)
SELECT e1.employee_id, count(e2.employee_id)
FROM employee e1 left join employee e2 on e1.team_id = e2.team_id
GROUP BY e1.employee_id

(window function)
select employee_id, count(employee_id) over (partition by team_id) as size
from employee
