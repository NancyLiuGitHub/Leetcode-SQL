MY SOLUTION (WRONG)
SELECT distint user1_id, user2_id, count(f2.user2_id) as common_friend
FROM Friendship f1 join Friendship f2 on f1.user2_id = f2.user1_id
GROUP BY 1,2
HAVING COUNT(f2.user2_id) >= 3


OTHER SOLUTION
with cte as (
SELECT user1_id as user, user2_id as friend
FROM friendship
union
SELECT user2_id as user, user1_id as friend
FROM friendship
)

Select f1.user, f2.user, count(f1.friend) as common_friend
from cte c1 join cte c2 on c1.friend = c2.friend (# to find common friend) and c1.user<c2.user (# to remove duplicate)
where (c1.user, c2.user) in (select * from friendship) -># c1.user is like user1_id, and c2.user is like user2_id from the original friendship table
group by 1,2
having count(f1.friend) >= 3
