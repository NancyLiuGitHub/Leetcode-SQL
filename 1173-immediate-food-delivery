select round(sum(case when order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date then 1 else 0 end))/count(delivery_id),4) *100
from delivery

select round(sum(if(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date, 1, 0))/count(delivery_id),4) *100

OTHER SOLUTION
select round(sum(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date)/count(*),4) *100
from delivery

select round(select count(*) from delivery where order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) /
(select count(*) from delivery), 4 ) * 100
