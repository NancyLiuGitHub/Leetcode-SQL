MY SOLUTION

SELECT activity_date, count(user_id)
FROM traffic
WHERE (user_id, activity_date) IN (
SELECT user_id, min(activity_date)
FROM traffiic
WHERE activity = 'login'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING min(activity_date)> date_sub("2019-06-30", interval 90 day)
)
GROUP BY activity_date


OTHER SOLUTION

SELECT login_date, count(*) as user_count
FROM (SELECT user_id, min(activity_date)
FROM traffiic
WHERE activity = 'login'
GROUP BY user_id) t
where login_date >= date_add('2019-06-30', interval -90 day) and login_date <= '2019-06-30'
# where datediff('2019-06-30', login_date) <= 90
group by login_date
