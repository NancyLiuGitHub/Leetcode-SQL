1)dense_rank
SELECT distinct a.id, name
FROM (
SELECT id, dense_rank() over (partition by id order by login_date range between interval '4' day preceding and current row) as r
FROM logins ) t
  JOIN accounts a ON t.id = a.id
WHERE r = 5
* Not sure it is correct or not


2)row
SELECT t.id, name
FROM (
  SELECT id, login_date, 
  row() over (partition by id over by login_date) as row_num,
  dateadd (day, -row() over (partition by id over by login_date), login_date) as group
  FROM 
    (select distinct id, login_date from logins)
  ) t join accounts a on t.id = a.id
GROUP BY t.id, name, group
HAVING count(distinct login_date)>=5

OTHER'S SOLUTION
SOLUTION 1: make 2) simplier: 1)convert the date into number -> 2)minus dense_rank() 3)get the grou

select a.id, a.name
from Accounts a
where a.id in
    (select l.id
    from (select distinct l.id, l.login_date,
              datediff(l.login_date, '1970-01-01') - dense_rank() over(partition by l.id order by l.login_date) as rk_group
          from Logins l) l
    group by l.rk_group, l.id
    having count(l.login_date) >= 5)
order by a.id

SOLUTION 2:
SELECT t.id, name
FROM (
  SELECT id, login_date, dense_rank() over (partition by id over by login_date) as r,
  FROM logins
  ) t join accounts a on t.id = a.id
GROUP BY t.id, name, date_sub(login_date, interval r day)
HAVING count(distinct login_date)>=5



SOLUTION 3(BEST)

SELECT distinct l1.id, name
FROM logins l1 join login2 l2 on l1.id = l2.id and datediff(l2.login_date, l1.login_date) between 1 and 4
  join accounts on a.id = l1.id
GROUP BY l1.id, l1.login_date
HAVING count(distinct l2.login_date) = 4
