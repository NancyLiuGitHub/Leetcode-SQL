My Solution
SELECT order_id
FROM (
SELECT order_id, AVG(quantity) avg_q, MAX(quantity) max_q
FROM OrdersDetails
GROUP BY order_id ) tmp
WHERE max_q > MAX(avg_q)

Other Solution
SELECT order_id
FROM OrdersDetails
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING MAX(quantity) > all (SELECT AVG(quantity) FROM OrdersDetails GROUP BY order_id)
