select distinct product_name
from product p join sales s on p.product_id = s.product_id
where sale_date between '...' and '...'

#wrong, doesn't consider product ONLY sold in the date range
#the output includes product sold in the other date outside the range as well, which we don't want it

select distinct product_name
from product p join sales s on p.product_id = s.product_id
group by product_name
having min(sale_date) between '...' and '...' and max(sale_date) between '...' and '...'

#to simplify
min(sale_date)>= '..' and max(sale_date) <= '..'


#other solution
SELECT DISTINCT s.product_id, p.product_name
FROM sales s left join product p on s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE s.product_id NOT IN (SELECT product_id FROM sales WHERE sale_date < '2019-01-01' or sales_date > '2019-03-31')
