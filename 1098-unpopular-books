MY SOLUTION
SELECT b.book_id, b.name
FROM Books b left join Orders o on b.book_id = o.book_id
WHERE available_from <= '2019-05-23' and year(dispatch_date) = '2018'
GROUP BY book_id
HAVING SUM(quantity)<10



OTHER SOLUTION

SELECT book_id, name
FROM books
WHERE available_from < '2019-05-23'
and book_id NOT IN
  (SELECT book_id
  FROM orders
  WHERE dispatch_date <= '2019-06-22' and dispatch_date >= '2018-06-23'
  GROUP BY book_id
  HAVING SUM(quantity) >= 10)
  
SELECT book_id, name
FROM books
WHERE available_from <= DATE_SUB("2019-06-23",INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
AND book_id NOT IN 
  (SELECT book_id 
  FROM orders 
  WHERE dispatch_date > DATE_SUB("2019-06-23", INTERVAL 1 YEAR
  GROUP BY book_id
  HAVING SUM(quantity)>=10)
