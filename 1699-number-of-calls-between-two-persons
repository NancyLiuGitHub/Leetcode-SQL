SELECT c1.from_id person1, c1.to_id person2, 
  count(c1.duration + ifnull(c2.duration)) as call_count,
  sum(c1.duration + ifnull(c2.duration,0)) as total_duration
FROM calls c1 left join calls c2 on c1.from_id = c2.to_id and c1.to_id = c2.from_id
WHERE c1.from_id < c1.to_id
GROUP BY c1.from_id, c1.to_id
## wrong

## correction, switch

SELECT person1, person2, count(duration), sum(duration)
FROM (
SELECT duration,
  case when from_id > to_id then to_id else from_id end as person1,
  case when from_id > to_id then from_id else to_id end as person2
from calls)
GROUP BY 1,2

##simplier version from other's solution
SELECT 
  if(from_id > to_id, to_id, from_id) person1,
  if(from_id > to_id, from_id, to_id) person2
  count(duration), sum(duration)
FROM calls
GROUP BY 1,2


OTHER SOLUTION
select from_id as person1,to_id as person2,
    count(duration) as call_count, sum(duration) as total_duration
from (select * 
      from Calls 
      union all
      select to_id, from_id, duration 
      from Calls) t1
where from_id < to_id
group by person1, person2
