MY SOLUTION

SELECT distinct id
FROM Confirmations c1 join Confiramtions c2 on c1.user_id = c2.user_id
WHERE c1.time_stamp <> c2.time_stamp and TIMEDIFF(c1.time_stamp, c2.time_stamp) < 24*60*60


OTHER SOLUTION
select..
from..
join..
on c1.user_id = c2.user_id
and timestampdiff(second, c2.time_stamp,c1.time_stamp) <= 86400
and timestampdiff(second, c2.time_stamp, c1.time_stamp) > 0

select..
from..
join..
on..
where c1.time_stamp < c2.time_stamp and timestampdiff(second, c1.time_stamp, c2.time_stamp)<=24*60*60
