MY SOLUTION
METHOD1
with cte as (
  SELECT *, rank() OVER (ORDER BY score desc) as r
  FROM schools, exam
  WHERE capacity > student_count
 )
 
 SELECT school_id, ifnull(score,0)
 FROM school s left join cte c on s.school_id = c.school_id
 WHERE r = 1
 
 
 METHOD2 (wrong)
 SELECT school_id, if(capacity > student_count, then min(score), -1) as score
 FROM school, exam
 
 METHOD3
 SELECT school_id, ifnull(min(score),-1) as score
 FROM schools s left join exam e
  on s.capactiy >= student_count ##cross doesn't work because where will filter the score where capacity < student
 GROUP BY school_id


OTHER SOLUTION
SELECT school_id, coalesce((SELECT MIN(score) from Exam where student_count <= capacity),-1) as score
FROM school

SELECT school_id, ifnull(min(score),-1) as score
from school left join exam on capacity >= student_count
group by school_id
