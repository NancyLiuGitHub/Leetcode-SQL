MY SOLUTION
select student_id, min(course_id), grade
from enrollment
where (student_id, grade) IN (
select student_id, max(grade)
from enrollment
group by student_id)
group by student_id, grade
order by student_id


OTHER SOLUTION (subqueries with relation)

select e1.student_id, min(e1.course_id), e1.grade
from Enrollments e1
where e1.grade = 
    (select max(grade)
    from Enrollments e2
    where e1.student_id = e2.student_id) 
group by e1.student_id
order by e1.student_id

(window fuction)
SELECT student_id, course_id, grade
FROM (SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY student_id ORDER BY grade desc, course_id) as r FROM enrollment) tmp
WHERE r = 1
ORDER BY student_id
