OTHER SOLUTION
SELECT country_name,
case when avg(weather_state) <= 15 then 'cold'
when avg(weather_state) >= 25 then 'hot'
else 'warm' end) as weather_type
FROM weather left join countries c on t.country_id = c.country_id
WHERE left(day,7) = '2019-11'
GROUP BY country_name


date options
1)where day between '2019-11-01' and '2019-11-30'
2)where left(day,7) = '2019-11'
