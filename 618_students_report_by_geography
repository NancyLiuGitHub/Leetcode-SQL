student: name, continent

result: continent1, continet2, ...
order by c1,c2...

select 
case when continent = 'America' THEN name END AS America,
case when continent = 'Europe' THEN name END AS Europe,
...
FROM student
ORDER BY America
### the result will contain null


to make it right:

select America, Aisa, Europe
FROM (
  SELECT name, row_num() over (order by name) as r
  FROM student
  WHERE contient = 'America'
) t2
LEFT JOIN ###(this is important because amarica has more or equal student than asia or europe)
 (SELECT name, row_num() over (order by name) as r
  FROM student
  WHERE contient = 'Asia') t2 on t1.r=t2.r
LEFT JOIN
  (SELECT name, row_num() over (order by name) as r
  FROM student
  WHERE contient = 'Europe') t3 on t1.r = t3.r
