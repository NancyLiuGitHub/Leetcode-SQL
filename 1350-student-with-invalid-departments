SELECT distinct s.id, s.name
FROM students s left join department d on s.department_id = d.id
WHERE d.name is null


OTHER SOLUTION (faster)

1)subquery
SELECT distinct id, name
FROM student s
WHERE NOT EXISTS 
  (SELECT NULL
  FROM department d
  WHERE s.id = s.department_id)
  
 
2) NOT IN
SELECT id,name
FROM students
WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM department)
