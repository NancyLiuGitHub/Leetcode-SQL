Generate all numbers from 1 to 100, and select the numbers in the range from 1 to 100 and not in customer_id.
select ids 
from 
(
    select x * 10 + y + 1 as ids 
    from 
    (
        select 0 as x union select 1 union select 2 union select 3 union select 4 union select 5 union select 6 union select 7 union select 8 union select 9
    ) as tens, 
    (
        select 0 as y union select 1 union select 2 union select 3 union select 4 union select 5 union select 6 union select 7 union select 8 union select 9
    ) as ones
    order by ids
) as num
where ids < (select max(customer_id) from Customers)
and ids not in (select distinct customer_id from Customers);
