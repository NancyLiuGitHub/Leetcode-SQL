didn't understand the question correctly!

SELECT if(a1<=a2,a1,a2) p1, if(a1<=a2, a2, a1) p2, a1*a2 area
FROM (
SELECT distinct abs(p1.x-p2.x) a1, abs(p1.y - p2.y) a2
FROM points p1 left join points p2 on p1.x != p2.x and p1.y != p2.y) t
ORDER BY area, p1, p2


correction
select a.id as p1, b.id as p2,
      (abs(a.x - b.x) * abs(a.y - b.y)) as area
from Points a, Points b   ## OTHER SOLUTION: points a left join points b on a.id<b.id
where a.id < b.id and a.x != b.x and a.y != b.y
