1) first call
2) last call
3) join 1) and 2) match by caller_id, recipient_id, and date(call_time)

with summary as (
select caller_id as caller1, recipient_id as caller2, call_time from calls
union all
select recipient_id as caller1, caller_id as caller2, call_time from calls)

with cte1 as (
select date(call_time) dat, caller1, caller2, min(call_time) time from summary group by 1,2
with cte2 as (
select date(call_time) dat, caller1, caller2, max(call_time) time from summary group by 1,2
)

SELECT distinct caller1 as user_id
FROM cte1 join cte2 on cte1.date = cte2.date and cte1.caller_id = cte2.caller_id and cte1.recipient_id_id = cte2.recipient_id

##answer above is wrong.
##has to use window function

1)keep the summary cte table
2)use rank() to record the min and max all time during the day per user

select distinct t1.caller1
FROM
(SELECT *, 
  rank() over (partition by caller1, date(call_time)) order by call_time) as min
FROM summary) t1 join 
(SELECT *, 
  rank() over (partition by caller1, date(call_time)) order by call_time desc) as max
FROM summary) t2 
 on t1.caller1 = t2.caller1 and date(t1.call_time) = date(t2.call_time) and min =1 and max =1 and t1.caller2 = t2.caller2
