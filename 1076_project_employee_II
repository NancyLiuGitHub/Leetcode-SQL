select project_id
from project 
group by 1
having count(employee_id)  = (select max(count(employee_id)) from project group by project_id)


#correction
max & count can't in the same line
= (select max(cnt) from (select count(employee_id) from project group by project_id))

or other solution -without max, use limit instead
= select count(employee_id) cnt from project group by project_id order by cnt desc limit 1)

or 
other solution
>= all(select count(employee_id) from project group by project_id
