select project_id
from project 
group by 1
having count(employee_id)  = (select max(count(employee_id)) from project group by project_id)


#correction
max & count can't in the same line
= (select max(cnt) from (select count(employee_id) from project group by project_id))

or 
other solution
>= all(select count(employee_id) from project group by project_id
