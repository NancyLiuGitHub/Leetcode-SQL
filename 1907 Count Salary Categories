with cte as (
SELECT CASE WHEN income < 20000 THEN 'Low Salary' 
WHEN income <= 50000 and income >= 20000 THEN 'Average Salary'
WHEN income > 50000 THEN 'High Salary' END
as category, account_id
from Accounts)

SELECT category, count(account_id)
from cte
group by category


Update
problem: Doesn't consider 0
how to add 0

Solution 1
1)create a empty table with 3 catergories 2)apply group by on the account table 3)join 

With cte as (
SELECT 'Low Salary' category
union
SELECT 'Average Salary' category
union
SELECT 'High Salary' category
)

with agg_acct (
SELECT CASE WHEN income < 20000 THEN 'Low Salary' 
WHEN income > 50000 THEN 'High Salary'
ELSE  'Average Salary' END as category,
count(account_id)
from Accounts
group by 1

SELECT category, ifnull(cnt, 0)
from cte left join FROM agg_acct a 
on cte.category = a.category


Solution 2
select "Low Salary" as category, count(*) as accounts_count from Accounts where income < 20000
union 
select "Average Salary" as category, count(*) as accounts_count from Accounts where 20000 <= income and income <= 50000
union
select "High Salary" as category, count(*) as accounts_count from Accounts where 50000 < income
