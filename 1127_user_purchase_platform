##wrong, should include 0 amount or 0 user count
1)create a new table with all three types for each day
with a1 as (
SELECT distinct spend_date, 'both' as platform 
FROM spending
union
SELECT distinct spend_date, platform
FROM spending
)

SELECT a1.spend_date, a1.platform, ifnull(a2.cnt, 0), ifnull(a2.tt, 0)
FROM a1
left join a2 (line1:line15)
on a1.spend_date = a2.spend_date and a1.platform = a2.platform
